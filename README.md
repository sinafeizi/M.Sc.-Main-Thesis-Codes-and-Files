ACO, ACO_old, GA_2018, GA_functions and PSP_functions are all Python files.
ACO.py -> runs my proposed Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for solving The Crew Pairing Problem as Set Covering Problem.
ACO_old.py -> runs the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm existing in the literature for solving the same problem.
GA_2018 -> runs the latest variation of the Genetic Algorithm existing in the literature for solving the same problem.
GA_functions -> runs a basic and simple variation the Genetic Algorithm existing in the literature for solving the same problem.
